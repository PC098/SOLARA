## Introduction

Solara is a powerful framework that allows developers to build interactive data dashboards using Python. It combines the simplicity of Python with the flexibility of React-like components, making it easy to create highly interactive and responsive dashboards.

This blog will guide you through the installation, key features, coding examples, and practical applications of Solara. By the end, you will have a complete understanding of how to build dashboards using Solara and deploy them using GitHub Pages.

## Installation & Setup

To get started with Solara, you need to install it using pip:

```sh
pip install solara

After installation, you can create a simple dashboard by running:
solara run
This command will start a development server where you can build and test your dashboard.
Key Features & Explanation
Reactive Components Solara uses a reactive programming model, similar to React, where components automatically update when state changes.

Seamless Integration with Jupyter & FastAPI Solara works well with Jupyter Notebooks and FastAPI, making it suitable for both data scientists and web developers.

Declarative UI The UI is built declaratively, meaning you define what should be displayed rather than how to update it.

Built-in Widgets Solara provides interactive widgets like sliders, dropdowns, and buttons, making it easy to add user input elements.

Markdown & Plots Support It supports Markdown rendering and plotting libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, and Altair.

Code Examples

Basic Example
import solara

@solara.component
def Page():
    name = solara.use_state("World")
    solara.InputText("Enter your name:", value=name)
    solara.Button("Greet", on_click=lambda: print(f"Hello, {name.value}!"))
    solara.Text(f"Hello, {name.value}!")

solara.run(Page)

Interactive Plot Example

import solara
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

@solara.component
def Page():
    a = solara.use_state(1.0)
    b = solara.use_state(0.0)
    x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
    y = a.value * x + b.value

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(x, y)
    solara.FigureMatplotlib(fig)

    solara.SliderFloat("Slope (a)", value=a, min=-5, max=5)
    solara.SliderFloat("Intercept (b)", value=b, min=-5, max=5)

solara.run(Page)
